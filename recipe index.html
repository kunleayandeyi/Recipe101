  <p>step 2: mix the chopped red pepper and chopped red onion to the bowl content</p>
  <p>step 3: add water and mix with hand till you have a thick paste mixture. The thickness determines the thickness of your puffpuff. I like my puffpuff thick, how do you like yours?</p>
  <p>step 4: cover the bowl and place your the bowl in a warm environment for minimum of 1 hour to allow the yeast to ferment </p>
  <p>step 5: put a deep pot on fire add enough oil to allow for deep frying and allow the oil to get hot, then reduce the heat of your cooker to allow even frying. Start scooping the mixture with your palm and drop it in a ball-like shape into the hot oil, allow to fry and turn it until u a colour has seen in the image above. Then pack it into your plate </p>
  <p> you can garnish and enjoy your puffpuff with cold juice or drink</p>

  <p>Tip 3: You can place a paper towel in your plate when packing your done puffpuff into plate</p>
